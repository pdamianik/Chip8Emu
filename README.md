# Chip8Emu

A [Chip-8 Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

## Disclaimer

This is just a test/experiment and shouldn't be used in production.

## Learning material

If you also wan't to build a Chip-8 emulator (it is easier than you might think) I recommend the following resources:

 - The [Chip-8 Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)
 - The [Guide to making a CHIP-8 emulator](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) by Tobias V. Langhoff

Additionally you can view the source code of this emulator or any other Chip-8 emulator out there (just google Chip-8 emulator, you will find a lot of repositories, maybe even in your preferred programming language). I personally used the [Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/Tandolf/chip8-emulator) by [Tandolf](https://github.com/Tandolf/) as a reference for some problems.
